## üè® Project Overview
This project analyzes the `hotel_bookings.csv` dataset to uncover trends in hotel bookings, focusing on cancellation patterns, booking behaviors, and key factors influencing cancellations. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and a predictive model for cancellations.

### üéØ Objectives
- Understand cancellation rates by hotel type, market segment, and lead time.
- Identify key factors driving cancellations.
- Create professional-grade visualizations to share with stakeholders.
- Build and evaluate a machine learning model to predict cancellations.

### üìä Dataset
- **Source**: `data/hotel_bookings.csv` (assumed to be the Kaggle Hotel Booking Demand dataset).
- **Key Columns**: `hotel`, `is_canceled`, `lead_time`, `children`, `country`, `adr`, `market_segment`, etc.

### üé® Color Palette
Inspired by interior design principles:
- **Warm Tones**: Represent resort hotels.
- **Cool Tones**: Represent city hotels.
- **Neutral Tones**: Used for cancellation trends.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RonoHenry/Hotel-Booking-Analysis.git
   ```
2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## üöÄ Usage Instructions
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data:
     ```bash
     python src/preprocess.py
     ```
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization**:
   - Open the notebook `Hotelbooking.ipynb` and execute the cells to perform EDA and generate visualizations.
3. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - Run the model training script:
     ```bash
     python src/model.py
     ```
   - Review the metrics and saved model in the `outputs/models` folder.

## üîç Key Insights
- **Cancellation Trends**: Resort hotels have higher cancellation rates compared to city hotels.
- **Lead Time**: Longer lead times are associated with higher cancellation rates.
- **Market Segment**: Online bookings show distinct cancellation patterns.

## üåü Future Improvements
- Enhance the predictive model with hyperparameter tuning.
- Deploy the model using a web application (e.g., Flask or Streamlit).
- Integrate additional datasets for deeper insights.
